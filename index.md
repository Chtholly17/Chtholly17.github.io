## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [VLAA Lab](https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/) in [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Yunyin Zhou](https://yuyinzhou.github.io/) and [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). I received bachelor degree in [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhangkai Ni](https://eezkni.github.io/). 

My research interest lies in **Deep Learning**.  I currently focus on building large-scale foundation model for biomedicine and single cell multi-omic data.

## Research Interests
