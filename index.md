## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [VLAA Lab](https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/) in [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Yuyin Zhou](https://yuyinzhou.github.io/) and [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). I received bachelor degree in [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhangkai Ni](https://eezkni.github.io/). 

My research interest lies in **Multi-modal Foundation Models**.  I currently focus on building large-scale foundation model for biomedicine and single cell multi-omic data. 

**I am looking for potential intern positions in the summer of 2025. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.**

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Multimodal Large Models.
- **Deep Learning:** Self-supervised Learning.
